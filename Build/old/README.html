<h1>Game of Thrones Season 3 Countdown</h1>

<p>This redesign is for the last 10 days of the countdown to Season 3 of Game of Thrones on HBO. The functionality is quite simple:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Show Days, Hours, Minutes, and Seconds until the premiere air date</li>
  <li>People can access released Trailers and other media (todo)</li>
  <li>People can share via Facebook &amp; Twitter</li>
  <li>The showâ€™s main theme can be played via a button in the top right corner</li>
  <li>Selecting a House will change the theme of the countdown to that of the selected House.</li>
</ol>
